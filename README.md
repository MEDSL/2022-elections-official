## Repository info
This is the MEDSL repository for election returns from the 2022 General Election in the United States. Election results are being hosted here while we compile a full national dataset and ensure the data meets our quality assurance standards. If you notice any issues in our results, please do open an Issue in this Github repository. 

So far, the following states are included in the dataset:

## Alabama

Added 2022-12-29. 

## District of Columbia

Added 2022-12-27. 

## Indiana

Added 2022-12-15.

* Only 36 of Indiana's 92 counties have so far released precinct-level election results in 2022. We publish these partial results now because, in 2020, only 56 counties ultimately released precinct-level results, so it is not guaranteed that Indiana's full 2022 election results will ultimately be released at the precinct level.

* We cannot conduct our usual county-level vote aggregation check in this state because counties reported at _either_ the precinct level or the county level, so the two levels of vote totals cannot be compared. So if you do want to use these data, we caution that results are non-systematically missing. Please carefully check the accuracy of any data you use from this state.

## Maryland

Added 2022-12-31.

* Maryland reported results separately from its "Mail-in Ballot 1 Canvass", which was held on November 10, 2022, and its "Mail-in Ballot 2 Canvass", which was held on November 18, 2022. Our dataset retains this distinction.

## Oklahoma

Added 2022-12-27. 

## Tennessee
